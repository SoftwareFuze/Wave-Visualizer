# Wave-Visualizer
This is a little app which you can visualize sine waves with.

You can use the little control panel in the top right corner to change the wave settings. Wave Length will change the frequency or the length of one iteration of the wave. Amplitude will change the depth of the wave. The Oscillate checkbox will toggle the state of the oscillating behavior. Once the Oscillate checkbox is checked, then you can update the speed of the oscillating.
